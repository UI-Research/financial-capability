    <h1>Financial Capabilities Feature</h1>
    <p>When families are able to manage their finances and weather financial shocks independently, they and their communities are better off. But a sizeable share of families are in financially precarious situations.</p>
    <p>Almost one in four families have no non-retirement savings and more than half have less than $5,000 in savings (figure 1).
    </p>
    <div id="graphic1" class="pym-small"></div>
    <p>Nearly 4 in 10 low-income families have no savings. But it’s not just a low-income problem: 8.7 percent of high-income families have no savings. The relationship between unsecured debt and financial security is less obvious: no debt might indicate financial prosperity or no access to credit. Families with more debt are typically more advantaged than families without debt.</p>

    <p>Families who experience financial shocks—such as job loss, a disability that limits work, or a large drop in income—are more likely to be evicted, miss housing and utility payments, and receive public benefits </p>

    <div id="graphic2" class="pym-small"></div>

    <p>Savings can help cushion the blow and protect families. Even a small amount of savings makes a difference (figure 7).</p>
    <div id="graphic3a" class="pym"></div>
    <p><b>Include evictions or note about exclusion</b></p>

    <p>And being low-income with $2,000-$4,999 in savings is better than being middle-income and living paycheck to paycheck (figure 9).</p>
    <div id="graphic3" class="pym"></div>
    <p>Annual family income thirds are composed as follows: bottom third, $0-$32,280; middle third, $32,280-$72,120; top third, $72,120 plus.</p>
    
    <p>So cities are/should be implementing programs to help families build and keep assets because it protects families and their communities. Here are some examples (specific policies/programs TBD): o Matched savings at tax time (Save USA) o Financial coaching o Integrated municipal services (affordable housing, small business development support, etc.) o Inclusive growth strategies/financial capability programs
