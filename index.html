    <h1>Financial Capabilities Feature</h1>
    <p>A city is only as strong as the people who live in it. When residents struggle to make ends meet, cities often do too. </p>

    <p>Take Detroit, a city that embodies the country’s slow recovery from the Great Recession. As of November 2015, the city’s official unemployment rate was 10.7 percent, more than double the national rate of 5 percent. Almost 40 percent of Detroit’s families live below the poverty line.</p>

    <p>As for the city itself, nearly three years since its 2013 bankruptcy, Detroit’s revenue sources are far from stable. In the 2016 budget, income tax revenue is anticipated to drop by $10 million. A recent study estimated that Detroit’s uncollected property taxes add up to more than $100 million. </p>

    <p>Coming up short on revenue forces decisionmakers to make tough choices about what programs to fund and what programs to cut. That has serious implications for schools, public safety, housing, and numerous other public services—the kind of services that also help families in need.</p>

    <p>Detroit isn’t alone. When residents of any city experience a financial shock—the loss of a job, a sharp drop in income, or an injury or illness that limits ability to work—the consequences can stretch beyond families and ripple throughout communities. New Urban Institute research finds that roughly one in seven American families at all income levels have suffered these shocks over the past year. </p>

    <p>“This isn’t just a low-income issue, it’s a middle-income issue, and to some extent, it’s also a high-income issue,” said Caroline Ratcliffe, senior fellow and coauthor of the report.</p>

    <p>For families, these income disruptions mean being more likely to miss housing or utility payments, receive public benefits, and, worst-case scenario, be evicted from their homes. Evictions in particular can have long-term effects on families, especially children. </p>

    <p>For cities, these income disruptions can mean reduced revenue from city-owned utilities and property taxes as citizens miss payments. They must stretch already-thin budgets to provide more public services and benefits to families that need them. </p>



    <h2>How savings can protect families from financial shocks</h2>

    <p>When families are able to manage their finances and weather financial shocks independently, they and their communities are better off. The key: savings, whether held in a checking, savings, or money market account, or nonretirement stocks and bonds.</p>

    <p>More savings means more of a cushion, but even a small amount in the bank helps. Having between $250 and $749 on hand is enough to reduce the likelihood of missing housing or utility payments or being evicted. Compared with families with no savings, those with as little as $1 to $250 are significantly less likely to receive public benefits.</p>

    <div id="graphic3a" class="pym"></div>
    <p><b>Include evictions or note about exclusion</b></p>


    <p>A few hundred dollars in savings “could help you pay a utility bill. That could keep you from taking out an auto title loan or a payday loan, which can lead you potentially into a spiral of debt,” said Signe-Mary McKernan, senior fellow and coauthor. “That doesn’t mean that more savings isn’t better…because we are finding that higher savings are associated with even lower hardship levels. So having more than $750 is going to get you even further. But don’t let that wanting-to-get-further keep you from getting started.”</p>

    <p>When it comes to withstanding these financial shocks, savings plays a bigger role than income. Analysis shows that being low income (in this report, defined as earning less than $32,280 a year) with $2,000 to $4,999 in savings is better than being middle income (bringing in between $32,280 and $72,120) and living paycheck to paycheck.</p>

    <div id="graphic3" class="pym"></div>

    <p>Unfortunately, nearly two-thirds (62 percent) of families have less than $5,000 in nonretirement savings accounts. Almost one in four (23.8 percent) don’t have any cash savings at all. </p>

    <p>Even those with $5,000 in the bank are considered asset poor—they could only support a family of three at the poverty level for three months.</p>

    <div id="graphic1" class="pym-small"></div>

    <p>And this isn’t just an issue for lower-income families. While savings do generally increase with income, about 1 in 10 high-income families making over $72,120 a year don’t have any savings, compared with 4 in 10 low-income families and 2 in 10 middle-income families.</p>

    <p>Automatic savings could be a solution. “It’s easier to save through your home because when that mortgage payment comes due, you automatically pay it, especially if you have some emergency savings to help make it. It’s easier to save through retirement when your employer automatically deducts it,” McKernan said. Regular, automatic contributions to a checking or savings account (or even a prepaid card)—“even if it’s a couple dollars or a couple percent of your income”— will add up over time. </p>

    <h2>How cities can promote saving</h2>
    <p>The federal government promotes saving through programs like the mortgage interest deduction and tax deductions for retirement savings, but “those incentives go primarily to high-income people,” Ratcliffe said. </p>

    <p>What can be done to help those with lower incomes save? That’s where cities come in. Through Volunteer Income Tax Assistance sites, affordable housing developments, and workforce development programs, cities can reach those in need and enroll them in programs that will help them build a nest egg.</p>

    <p>Programs that offer matched savings at tax time, when many low- and middle-income families receive an influx of cash via a tax refund, have shown promise. SaveUSA, an asset-building program that operated in four US cities, offered eligible low-income families a 50 percent match on savings held for a year. After three and a half years, participating families had increased their savings by an average of $522—enough to help lessen the impact of an income disruption.</p>

    <p>Individual development accounts, which are administered through nonprofits and local governments, also provide matching funds to lower-income families who are saving with a goal in mind: to purchase a home, launch a business, or pay for college. </p>

    <p>Some cities offer one-on-one financial coaching, which matches participants with a “coach” who helps identify action steps toward better financial health. Participants in one city’s coaching program made more deposits, saw their balances grow, and got closer to reaching their savings goals. </p>

    <p>Though they won’t come cheap, introducing these programs to communities is ultimately in local leaders’ best interest. “These are initiatives that cost money, but they can help people take that next step and provide financial security,” said Ratcliffe. By strengthening the financial health of their residents, cities are protecting their own financial health as well. </p>
