    <h1>Financial Capabilities Feature</h1>
    <p>A city is only as strong as the people who live in it. When residents struggle to make ends meet, cities often do too. </p>

    <p>Take Detroit, a city that has become almost the poster child for the slow recovery from the Great Recession. As of November 2015, the city’s official unemployment rate was 10.7 percent, more than double the national rate of 5 percent. Almost 40 percent of the city’s families live below the poverty line.</p>

    <p>As for the city itself, nearly three years since its 2013 bankruptcy, Detroit’s revenue sources are far from stable. In the 2016 budget, income tax revenue is anticipated to drop by $10 million. A recent study estimated that Detroit’s uncollected property taxes add up to more than $100 million, about a tenth of its budget. </p>

    <p>Coming up short on revenue forces decisionmakers to make tough choices about what programs to fund and what programs to cut. That has serious implications for schools, public safety, housing, and numerous other public services—the kind of services that also help families in need.</p>

    <p>Detroit isn’t alone. When people experience a financial shock—the loss of a job, a sharp drop in income, or an injury or illness that limits ability to work—the consequences can stretch beyond families and ripple throughout communities. New Urban Institute research finds that roughly one in seven American families at all income levels have suffered these shocks over the past year. </p>

    <p> “This isn’t just a low-income issue, it’s a middle-income issue, and to some extent, it’s also a high-income issue,” said Caroline Ratcliffe, senior fellow and coauthor of the report.</p>

    <p>For families, these income disruptions mean being more likely to miss housing or utility payments, receive public benefits, and, worst-case scenario, be evicted from their homes. Evictions in particular can have long-term effects on families, especially children. </p>

    <p>For cities, these income disruptions can mean reduced revenue from city-owned utilities and property taxes as citizens miss payments, and stretching already-thin budgets to provide more public services and benefits to families that need them. </p>

    <h2>How savings can protect families from financial shocks</h2>

    <p>When families are able to manage their finances and weather financial shocks independently, they and their communities are better off. The key: savings, whether held in a checking, savings, or money market account, or nonretirement stocks and bonds.</p>

    <p>More savings means more of a cushion, but even a small amount in the bank helps. Having between $250 and $749 on hand is enough to reduce the likelihood of missing housing or utility payments or being evicted. Compared with families with no savings, those with as little as $1 to $250 are significantly less likely to receive public benefits.</p>
    
        <div id="graphic3a" class="pym"></div>
    <p><b>Include evictions or note about exclusion</b></p>

    <p>Why do such small savings make such a big difference? “That could help you pay a utility bill. That could keep you from taking out an auto title loan or a payday loan, which can lead you potentially into a spiral of debt,” said Signe-Mary McKernan, senior fellow and coauthor. </p>

    <p>“Even if your rent is more than $750, you can help bridge that gap that you wouldn’t have if you didn’t have the resources,” added Ratcliffe.</p>

    <p>“That doesn’t mean that more savings isn’t better in this case, because we are finding that higher savings are associated with even lower hardship levels. So having more than $750 is going to get you even further. But don’t let that wanting-to-get-further keep you from getting started,” said McKernan.</p>

    <p>When it comes to withstanding these particular financial shocks, savings plays a bigger role than income. Analysis shows that being low-income with $2,000 to $4,999 in savings is better than being middle-income with nothing in the bank. </p>


    <h2>Who has savings?</h2>
    <p>Unfortunately, nearly two-thirds (62 percent) of families have less than $5,000 in nonretirement savings accounts. Almost one in four (23.8 percent) don’t have any cash savings at all. </p>

    <p>Even those with $5,000 in the bank are considered asset poor—they could only support a family of three at the poverty level for three months.</p>

    <div id="graphic1" class="pym-small"></div>

    <p>And this isn’t just an issue for low-income families. While savings do generally increase with income, about 1 in 10 high-income families earning over $72,120 a year don’t have any savings, compared with 4 in 10 who make less than $32,280 a year and 2 in 10 who bring in between $32,280 and $72,120 a year.</p>

    <p>What keeps people from saving, especially those at higher incomes? Some people live paycheck to paycheck and don’t feel like they’re able to save. For others, it’s just not front of mind. But all would benefit from taking an automatic approach to setting up savings.</p>

    <p>“It’s easier to save through your home because when that mortgage payment comes due, you automatically pay it, especially if you have some emergency savings to help make it. It’s easier to save through retirement when your employer automatically deducts it,” said McKernan. Regular, automatic contributions to a checking or savings account (or even a prepaid card)—“even if it’s a couple dollars or a couple percent of your income”— will add up over time.</p>

    <h2>How cities can promote saving</h2>
    <p>The federal government incentivizes saving through programs like the mortgage interest deduction and tax deductions for retirement savings, but “those incentives go primarily to high-income people,” explained Ratcliffe. </p>

    <p>What can be done to help those with lower incomes save? That’s where cities come in. Through Volunteer Income Tax Assistance sites, affordable housing developments, and workforce development programs, cities can reach those in need and enroll them in programs that will help them build a nest egg.</p>

    <p>Programs that offer matched savings at tax time, when many low- and middle-income families receive an influx of cash via a tax refund, have shown promise. SaveUSA, an asset-building program that operated in four US cities, offered eligible low-income families a 50 percent match on savings held for a year. After three and a half years, participating families had increased their savings by an average of $522—enough to help lessen the impact of an income disruption.</p>

    <p>Individual development accounts, which are administered through nonprofits and local governments, also provide matching funds to lower-income families who are saving with a goal in mind: to purchase a home, launch a business, or pay for college. </p>

    <p>Some cities offer one-on-one financial coaching, which matches participants with a “coach” who helps identify action steps toward better financial health. Participants in one city’s coaching program made more deposits, saw their balances grow, and got closer to reaching their savings goals. </p>

    <p>By ensuring the financial health of their residents, cities are protecting their own financial health as well. But while cities can do their part by providing incentives to save, it’s ultimately up to individual citizens to take action and build assets.</p>

    <p>“Get started on your emergency savings and then that’s going to make your city better and yourself better,” said McKernan. “That’s the first step.”</p>
